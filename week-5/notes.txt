1. Why do we need react ?
------> For static we don't, 
for dynamic website, these libs make it easier to do DOM manipulation.
React is a new syntax that under hood gets converted to html/CSS/JSS

2. React Jargon

State : An object that represents current state of the app. It represents dynamic thing in your app. e.g. value of counter

Component: How a DOM element should render, given a state. It is re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state.
The button is a comp. It takes a state(counter) as an input and is supposed to render accordingly.

Re-render : A state change triggers re-render. A re-render represents actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes

Define Component once, change the state, react will take care of rerendering.
