Why does a react component returns a high level parent & not siblings ?

siblings
<div></div>
<div></div>

high level parent
<parent>
    <child></child>
    <child></child>
</parent>

-> It makes easy for reconciliation (changes to DOM)


Solution : use <React.Fragment>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In react, re-renders should be minimize as much as possible.

Rerender happens when the state used inside the component changes or parent component re-renders (It will trigger re-render for each child)

So inorder to minimize re-renders, one solution will be push down the state to child components.

Rule of thumb: declare state varibles at lowest common ancesters

Second solution is we can use React.Memo(comp_func), Memo lets you skip rendering a comp if props are unchanged

-----------------------------------
whenever iterating the array, we need to add key to component, helps react in sorting & re-rendering

Wrapper component : Takes another comp as input (props)

whenever defining a comp, you can take children as input, if that component is called children will contain every thing passed inside the component.

<componet>
// children 
<div>I am children of component </div>
</component>
