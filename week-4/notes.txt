------------------- Document Object Model --------------------------------

- Using class name in html helps in styling the element, It follows DRY principle.
- If you want to style elements in similar way, using same class helps
- Why are Ids useful ? What do ids let you do ?
- Let you access elements via DOM API

Debouncing : don't send out req immediately, if user hasn't typed for 100 ms then send request


document.getObjectbyId(t) // gets html object with id t
document.createElement(t) // creates am outer element with tag t


---------------------- React Foundations ----------------------------

DOM is not enough to support dynamic websites as no central state.

state : current state of application provided by backend, e.g. The backend sends an array of Todo list & we need to render it to frontend

Way to create a dynamic frontend websites:

1. Update a state variable.
2. Delegate the task of figuring out diff to a hefty func.   ----> done by react
3. Tell the hefty func how to add, update & remove element.
